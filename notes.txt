.Referencing and Embedding.

By default, Mongo was not focused on creating relationships between documents or collections, but still to do this, we
have the method of referencing and embedding, where we embed the reference of a document in another document inside an
array which is present in another document.


Now this embedding takes place in a simple manner, in which Document IDs of connecting documents is stored in the main
document as an array.

main - document
User {
    name:
    age:
    address:
    reviews: [
        objectID(1), // review 1
        objectID(2), // review 2
        objectID(3)  // review 3
    ]
    ...
}


connected - documents
reviews {
    desc:
    rating:
    boughtOn:
    ...
}

Types of relationships

1. One to One
    Single document has only one connected document.
    Ex: "User" and "Login Info"

2. One to Many
    Single document is connected to many other connected documents.
    Ex: "User" and "Reviews"

3. Many to Many
    Multiple documents are connected to multiple connected documents.
    Ex: "Students" and "Subjects"
        A student is connected to multiple subjects.
        A subject has multiple students.
